<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>Notes:<br>Calcination results in removal off the electrolyte.<br><br>Definitions:<br>Calcining - to heat (as inorganic materials) to a high temperature but without fusing to drive off volatile matter or to effect changes (as oxidation or pulverization). This process is typically used for the removal of organic material, combined water and/or volatile material from a material.
