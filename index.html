  <strong>
   Purpose:
  </strong>
  Recovering valuable materials and extending the life of electric vehicle batteries are important steps to address the challenges of supply chain vulnerability and material sourcing difficulties. These recovery pathways are still in their early stages, with many challenges including the broad range of battery chemistries, low resource intensity and process efficiency for lithium recovery in recycling, and safety concerns from material handling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   To facilitate the coordination of battery circularity efforts and research, we introduce a reference model to outline the activities required to recover and treat end-of-life electric vehicle batteries.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reference Model:
  </strong>
  The Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB) Recovery Model is adapted from the 
  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/reference-functional-model-production-circular-economy">
  Production in a Circular Economy (CE) Model
  </a>
  , which lays out five activities for manufacturing in a CE. This battery recovery model corresponds to the Treat at End of Life (activity A5) of the manufacturing CE model. This model describes the recovery steps within repurposing, remanufacturing, and recycling an EVB. An overview of these pathways can be seen below (figure adapted from SAE J3327).

 Circular Product Design
</h2>
<div class="info">
 The
 <a href="pce/pce/dgmA1COLON_Design_Product4091.html">
  Circular Product Design (CPD) Activity Model
 </a>
 is a model of the activities and systems involved in designing for circularity. 
CPD is an approach that enables designers to facilitate the creation of products for a circular economy (CE). 
A key need for CPD is to leverage data from downstream life cycle stages to inform design decisions both initially and iteratively. 
The CPD Activity Model outlines design activities and the data to be collected from each other stage of the product lifecycle as it relates to design activities. 
Users of the CPD model can include CE researchers, product designers, and standards development bodies, among others.
 <p>
  The model serves as a resource to:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Identify differences in data needs and considerations for CPD practices, compared to traditional product design practices
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify areas within CPD that require further development of tools, measurement methods, or standards
   </li>
   <li>
    Determine the data collection necessary to guide design decisions and assess their downstream impacts
   </li>
   <li>
    Plan for information tracking throughout a product life cycle
   </li>
  </ul>

 Closed Loop Recovery

<div class="info">
 The
 <a href="pce/pce/dgmA5COLON_Treat_at_End_of_Life138.html">
  Closed Loop Recovery (CLR) Activity Model
 </a>
 is an activity in the Production in a CE model that focuses on the end-of-life treatment of products and the flows relevant to developing secondary material streams. The CLR Activity Model outlines the activities and relationships involved in material recovery, including R-strategies such as reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Users of the CLR model can include CE researchers, end-of-life recovery and waste management professionals, designers who want to understand downstream processing, and standards development bodies, among others.
