Notes:
<br/>
Can include screening/testing, sorting, and classifying. Used to identify cells that cannot meet refurbishment or repurposing requirements and to group batteries with similar levels of degradation and electrochemical performance. Screening is often done exploratorily on a general sample population whereas testing may be conducted on individual batteries for well-defined purposes. Testing includes safety and performance testing. Also referred to as screening in the literature. Can include electrochemical, observational, and other advanced testing methods (ultrasound).
<br/>
<br/>
Definitions:
<br/>
Sorting - physical separation or grouping according to defined attributes (i.e., classes). Sorting can be based on electrical chemical parameters, chemistry, and physical appearance (Rehman, et al., (2024) (see references below). Adapted from ISO 59014:2024(en), 3.20.
<br/>
<br/>
Screening (test) - application of any analytical semi-quantitative method for exploratory analysis. Adapted from ISO 12404:2021(en).
